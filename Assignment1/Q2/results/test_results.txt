Based on the pngs generated from the data analysis, we can assume a few things about the correlation of data.

The average scores by gender shows us a few things. We can see from the data that the average score of males in math is 6% higher on average than
the females. We can also see that the females tend to score higher in reading and writing with an increase of roughly 10-12% in each subject.

The average scores by lunch type is also pretty interesting. From the graphics we can see that those with free/reduced lunch tend to have lower
scores than those with standard lunches. The scores tend to increase by 6-12% in each category.

The math score by parents level of education box plot shows some interesting data. This graphic shows that although the averages tend to be similar,
with the students who have parents with a master's degree performing slightly better, the outliers are worse. We can see that there are less outliers
as the parents education increases. The students who have parents with some college or less have more negative outliers.

The percent of ethicity/race groups that completed the test prep show that the average among the groups are pretty similar. The average of groups A, B,
and C are all pretty close to 35%, whereas group D is slightly lower at 31% and group E is slightly higher at 43%.

The test prep impact box plots show that the range of scores tend to be shifted up when the students take the prep course. This is shown through all of
the subjects. The ones who complete the test prep are also less likely to have lower score outliers.
