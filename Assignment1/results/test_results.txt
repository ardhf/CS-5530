The above results are from the t-tests performed on the data. Since none of the t-statistics are 0, it 
shows that there is some relationship between the data and the frailty attribute in women. However, the
P-values for each column are not within 0.05 which would prove statistical significance. Therefore, the data 
given does not prove to be statisticly significant towards determining the frailty in females. These results
may change with the addition of more data, but with the limited data here, there seems to be no correlation.
