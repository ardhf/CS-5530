# ðŸ¤– Transformer-Based Chatbot (General Attempt)

This repository contains an experimental Transformer-based chatbot built using PyTorch. The initial goal was to train a general-purpose chatbot using open-domain dialog data, with plans to fine-tune it for a healthcare setting. This version focuses on the first attempt, which encountered several limitations.
