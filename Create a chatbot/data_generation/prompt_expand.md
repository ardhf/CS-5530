# Human Prompt for Intent Expansion

The generated prompt in `prompt_fill_batch.txt` was issued to ChatGPT-o3 with each batch of intents to generate some patterns and responses for each intent.

Then the following prompt was given to ChatGPT-4o:

> Now I need a third prompt to expand each batch to increase the number of patterns by 3x and responses by 1.5x

The following long prompt was generated and then given repeatedly to ChatGPT-o3 along with each `intents_##_filled.json` to further expand on the patterns and responses for each intent.

# Generated Prompt

You are provided with a **batch of chatbot intents**.  
Each intent already contains a **moderate number** of patterns (user utterances) and responses (chatbot replies).

---

## ðŸ©º Your Task:

For each intent:

- **Expand** the number of `patterns` (user utterances) by approximately **3Ã—**.
- **Expand** the number of `responses` (chatbot replies) by approximately **1.5Ã—**.

**DO NOT modify** the `tag`, `context`, or `required_context` fields.  
**DO NOT** remove any existing patterns or responses â€” **only add** new ones.

---

## ðŸ©º Style Guidelines:

### Patterns (User Utterances)
- Add **natural and believable variations** of how a visitor or patient might ask the same thing.
- Use a mix of:
  - **Short questions** and **longer full sentences**
  - **Formal** and **casual** phrasing
  - **Native** and **non-native English** styles
- Minor typos, slight awkwardness, and different grammatical structures are acceptable.

### Responses (Chatbot Replies)
- Add **polite, clear, professional** new replies.
- **Moderate variety is sufficient**:
  - Small differences in phrasing, tone, or formality are enough.
  - Full rewording is not required unless natural.
- **Emergency/medical-related intents** must always defer politely to **hospital staff or 911**.

## ðŸ©º Example:

Starting Input:

```json
{
  "tag": "find_pharmacy",
  "patterns": [
    "Where is the pharmacy?",
    "How do I get prescriptions filled?"
  ],
  "responses": [
    "Our hospital pharmacy is on the ground floor next to the atriumâ€”follow the purple â€˜Pharmacyâ€™ signs."
  ],
  "context": "",
  "required_context": []
}
```

Expanded Output:

```json
{
  "tag": "find_pharmacy",
  "patterns": [
    "Where is the pharmacy?",
    "How do I get prescriptions filled?",
    "Can you show me where the pharmacy is?",
    "Is there a pharmacy inside the hospital?",
    "Where can I pick up my medicine?",
    "I need to find the hospital drugstore.",
    "Is the pharmacy open now?",
    "Which way is the pharmacy from the entrance?"
  ],
  "responses": [
    "Our hospital pharmacy is on the ground floor next to the atriumâ€”follow the purple â€˜Pharmacyâ€™ signs.",
    "Youâ€™ll find the pharmacy on Level 0, just beyond the atrium area.",
    "The hospital pharmacy is located on the ground floor near the main elevators."
  ],
  "context": "",
  "required_context": []
}
```

## ðŸ©º Special Instructions:
- **Patterns**: Add **about 3Ã—** more patterns. (Slightly exceeding is fine if natural.)
- **Responses**: Add **about 1.5Ã—** more responses. (Round up if needed.)
- **Preserve** the strict JSON format â€” no extra or missing fields.
- Do **NOT** invent unrelated topics or new intents.
